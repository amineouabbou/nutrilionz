Happy to share with you this small projet.

It's a PWA blazing fast ðŸš€ðŸš€, i had a lot of fun working on this :D.

It's a small projet, but baked using the latest technologies out there: Gatsby (react of course :D), graphql, modular css, hooks, Apollo client, ...

I'am using wordpress API for data serving (headless wordpress).

The projet is full SEO optimized.

Enjoy !
